[ What is libece? ]

libece is a simplified Switchboard communication library which provides
functionality to handle:
 - request and renewal of Operation certificates
 - retrieval of license info and VPN connection configuration

, whilst hiding internal Qt-based C++ implementation including a
JSON-over-HTTPS communication channel, PKI management and licensing details.

[ Build ]

Install QtCreator (tested on Ubuntu 12.04 with Qt 4.8.1-0ubuntu4.4), then:

$ qmake
$ make 
$ make install 

Run tests with:

$ make check  # Note: requires Switchboard or simulator.

[ Logging ]

Follow syslog() numbering, for example modifying common.pri as follows:

QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -DECE_LOGLEVEL=7

which will increase to maximum verbosity (default is 3).

#define LOG_EMERG   0   /* system is unusable */
#define LOG_ALERT   1   /* action must be taken immediately */
#define LOG_CRIT    2   /* critical conditions */
#define LOG_ERR     3   /* error conditions */
#define LOG_WARNING 4   /* warning conditions */
#define LOG_NOTICE  5   /* normal but significant condition */
#define LOG_INFO    6   /* informational */
#define LOG_DEBUG   7   /* debug-level messages */
