[[ Test environment info ]]

Prerequisites: 
    - add appropriate "initialization-host" "operation-host" definitions to /etc/hosts
    - to generate OpenVPN server correctly, add the following to openssl.conf:
        [ server ]
        nsCertType            = server

$ cd sb
$ ./inst.sh

The script will:
- generate 2 test CAs
- create credentials for SB simulator services and LIBENCLOUD
- configure apache accordingly
